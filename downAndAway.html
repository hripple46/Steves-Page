                In DOWN AND AWAY, the setting of October Sky meets the family
                complexity of The Fabelmans. It was 1915 in Chisholm, Minnesota.
                Max realized at an early age that he wanted to become a doctor.
                But the need to help his mother pay the bills made life as an
                iron ore miner the only path he could see. A horrific mining
                accident that took the life of his best friend made him realize
                that a different path to becoming a doctor was needed. Through
                the help of local baseball-player-turned-doctor, Archibald
                Graham, Max was able to chart a different course. He was
                determined to never again enter the depths of an iron ore mine.
                Despite so many challenges, including family members who weren’t
                what they seemed, Max found hope on a baseball field. DOWN AND
                AWAY will appeal to readers who grew up in small towns and
                readers who want something more than their current environments
                can provide. Additionally, it will appeal to anyone who has ever
                seen baseball as more than a sport. I am a life-time resident of
                Minnesota, and a life-time fan of baseball. I graduated with a
                degree in Creative Writing from the University of Minnesota. I’m
                also the grandson of Rudy Ripple, the real-life miner, turned
                baseball player, turned doctor on whom this book was based.
