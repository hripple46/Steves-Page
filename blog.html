            I have been fortunate enough to have volunteered at Loaves and Fishes for a long time.
            However, being the innovators that they are, Loaves and Fishes has expanded greatly, and adapted
            their business model to continue to meet the needs of their Guests. So, in an effort to better
            understand the &quot;new&quot; Loaves and Fishes, I am attempting to help out at a lot of sites over the next
            month or so. I&#39;m calling it &quot;20 sites in 40 nights&quot;. Please read along with my posts as I make my way
            around the Twin Cities. Additionally, if you are so compelled, please visit this link to either volunteer
            your time, or donate some money. Every $10 donated can feed a family of four! Thanks, and we’ll
            see you Monday at site #1!</p>

            <p>Guess what color I’ll be seeing in my dreams tonight? That’s right, I cut two crates of
                oranges at the Holy Rosary site. They were served as part of a delicious, nutritious meal served to
                over 250 hungry guests that waited patiently for their takeaway dinners. Most of the guests live down
                the street as part of the Little Earth Residence Association. I worked alongside six amazing,
                dedicated volunteers who have spent the first Monday of every month for the last 40 years, serving
                meals in this South Minneapolis community.</p>

                    <p>My second site visit brought me to Crystal, MN. Crystal is a beautiful suburb of Minneapolis,
                        once again proving that the need is everywhere.
                        I helped out the kind volunteers from Valley of the Peace, as they served meals at one of L&amp;F’s Twin
                        Cities sites - Brunswick United Methodist Church. The site coordinator, Angela, put together an
                        amazing meal for 60 hungry and thankful guests Admirably, she is a “floater” for L&amp;F, meaning she
                        goes to whichever sites she is needed that day. The food was delivered to the site earlier in the day
                        by the Commissary Kitchen - a central spot for gathering, assembling, and disseminating nutritious
                        meals.</p>

                            <p>Bad weather doesn&#39;t stop mail carriers, and it evidently doesn&#39;t stop Loaves and Fishes,
                                either. The snow was flying on Saturday, but hungry guests still lined up, happy to take hot meals
                                home to their families on a blustery winter&#39;s night.
                                Last night&#39;s meal was the most delicious yet. Provided by India Palace of Eden Prairie, this meal of
                                rice, beans, naan, and apple slices was absolutely amazing. Our leader, Robin, directed me and the
                                other volunteers (the Sikh Society) in plating and serving over 90 guests. Members of the Sikh
                                Society show up to this facility every month (the 2nd Saturday) and happily feed all that make the
